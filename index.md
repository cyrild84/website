## Hi
I'm a french game developer, who like to travel and explore new spaces.
I'm currently residing in Quebec.

I have worked for game studios and companies as game designer, level designer, scripter or programmer.
During 3 years, I shared my experiences and enthusiasm for video game as game design trainer at Rubika India Supinfogame.

I'm currently working at <a href="https://quebec.ubisoft.com/en">Ubisoft Quebec</a> as Associate Technical Director.


You can have look at my <a href="http://www.cyrildupont.fr/?page=about">resume</a> and <a href="http://www.cyrildupont.fr/?page=portfolio">portfolio</a>.
Enjoy !
